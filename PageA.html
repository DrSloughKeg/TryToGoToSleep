        I should already be sleeping. It's so hard to go to bed on time. I don't
        know how I keep ending up in this situation. Maybe I should start
        setting an alarm to let me know when it's time to sleep. Does that make
        any sense? Wake up to an alarm, go to sleep to an alarm? Either way,
        it's time for bed now.
